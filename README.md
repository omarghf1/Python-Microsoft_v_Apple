# Microsfot vs. Apple Analysis with Python

This analysis was done as the final team project for a Machine Learning class at Hult International Business School, as we finished our Masters in Business Analytics.

## Our Task
We completed a survey of 392 people and we asked them 78 questions about their personalities, interests, and their preference between Microsoft laptops and Macbooks.

## Main Question to Answer
Can we discover who is a Microsoft user vs. a Apple user based on personal characteristics or their personality?

## Survey Composition
The questions in the survey were composed of The Big 5 Personality Test, the Hult DNA, and general demographic questions.

**What is The Big 5 Personality Test?**</br>
This is a widely accepted social science technique to test personalities, and famously known to be the tecnique Cambridge Analytica used predict which personalities voting behaviors in the 2016 US Presidential Election (source: [Hereâ€™s the personality test Cambridge Analytica had Facebook users take](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-personality-test-cambridge-analytica-data-trump-election-2018-3). It breaks down a personalities into 5 dimensions and ranks them High or Low in each one. The dimensions are: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (source: [The Big Five Personality Traits](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)).

**The Hult DNA**</br>
The Hult DNA is a set of aspirations for the professional development of Hult students around the world, and a tool to assist the alignment of their skills with future employer needs. They are grouped into three Thinking, Communicating and Team Building. These further breakdown into:

- Thinking: Shows Self Awareness
- Thinking: Embraces Change
- Thinking: Demonstrates Dynamic Thinking
- Communicating: Speaks and Listens Skillfully
- Communicating: Influences Confidently
- Communicating: Presents Ideas Effectively
- Team Building: Builds collaborative Relationships
- Team Building: Inspires and Motivates
- Team Building: Resolves Conflicts Constructively


## Final Analysis
Ultimately, we found interesting insights by breaking down the demographics information of the survey participants into Generational (based on the year they were born in), Regional (based on the country they were from), Nationality (based on the country they were from). 

### Insight 1
There was an even split for both Macbook and Windows laptops; 51% of audience size for Macbook and 49% for Windows. However, there was a 7% drop; 4.9% to Macbook and the rest to Chromebook, in future laptop ownerships for Windows. In grouping the age for further analysis, Gen Z preferred purchasing a Macbook (75%: 45 users). The Windows proportion for Gen Y, declined by 9% from 53%, totaling 30 users, which is a significant drop in interest from their older customers. This indicates an overall loss in market share for Windows if laptops are the same price.

### Insight 2
Focusing on South America, there is a clear distinction in their laptop ownership. Looking at Windows laptop preference, for South America, 69% (35 users) favor a Windows laptop. Macbook prices in South America are some of the highest rates in comparison to other countries, which could be a big reason Windows computers are preferred (Nottrodt, 2020). However, despite the apparent higher prices in South America, when asked what would be their ideal next laptop, there is a decline in Windows users, falling from 69% to 52%, totaling 8 users. 

### Insight 3
Comparing the regions, we analyzed vs. the top 5 nationalities surveyed, we found:
- All regions except Europe lose interest in Windows by an average of 11%.
- We observed Chinese, German and American students increase interest by an average of 13%.

Considering these factors, there is an opportunity to explore more and find final conclusions for marketing opportunities:
- This could mean that highly educated people, in the countries mentioned above, see benefits in using Windows.
- International students could be an interesting market for Microsoft to target.
- Young professionals may see an added value to buying Windows early on their careers.
