    "Countless consumers have pondered this question when preparing to buy a new computer. As a result, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been rigorously researching several aspects of consumer buying behavior in regards to the decision making behind this question. Both firms have commissioned research and analysis teams to study aspects such as system architecture, security, and overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, Microsoft has decided to approach this question from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits as well as the Hult DNA. As such, your team has been commissioned to run an analysis on these factors. Microsoft is looking forward to receiving your key insights, as well as an organized Jupyter Notebook that can be shared with their internal analytical teams. They also have sent you a kind reminder to utilize external research to support your findings and to give details related to important information such as audience size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Big Five personality test measures the five personality factors that psychologists have determined are core to our personality makeup. The Five Factors of personality are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Openness - How open a person is to new ideas and experiences\n",
    "- Conscientiousness - How goal-directed, persistent, and organized a person is\n",
    "- Extraversion - How much a person is energized by the outside world\n",
    "- Agreeableness - How much a person puts others' interests and needs ahead of their own\n",
    "- Neuroticism - How sensitive a person is to stress and negative emotional triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis\n",
    "In this analysis we will look into 392 survey responders that answered 77 questions. We will look into separating the types of questions into their Big Five personality traits. We will also separate the Hult DNA questions into 3 groups based on information provided in the Hult Handbook. Using this information we will explore the data and determine if there are any overarching insights prior to diving deeper into the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploration, we will organize our data and utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques - PCAs and Clustering to determine the types of customer that would purchase either a Macbook or Windows computer. Our goal is to help Microsoft determine unique customers that can be isolated and find out which customers are more inclined to remain or switch from their current laptop owned.\n",

    " \n",
    "Low Mean Scores:\n",
    " - Question - \"Insult people\" has the lowest mean rating at 1.73. This could tell us that people don't like hurting other people's feelings so the score is low\n",
    " - Question - Do not have a good imagination\" had a low mean rating 2.11, telling us that most users believe that have a good imagination and think out of the box.\n",
    " - Question \"Am not interested in abstract ideas\" had a low mean rating 2.13, we could speculate that people are interested in abstract ideas and are generally curious.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Mean Scores:\n",
    " - Question \"Drive for results\", had the highest average score 4.28. This question was part of the Hult DNA group, meaning a lot of students at Hult could be motivated to succeed.\n",
    " - Questions \"Work well with people from diverse cultural backgrounds\", also scored high at 4.26 average score. This would make sense since Hult is one of the most diverse International schools in the world. We would expect students to be familiar with working with multiple cultures. \n",
    " - Question \"Display a growth mindset\", another Hult DNA question where there was a high mean score. Similarly to drive results, this could tell us the type of student body we have at Hult and motivate individuals are continuously looking to grow."

Their consumption habits lean towards uniqueness, ethical and unlimited. On the other hand, Gen Y are confident and ambitious and highly value teamwork. Their consumption habits lean towards experience, festivals, travel and flagships (best products or services).

    "# Name Principal Components\n",
    "We can name the results based on what similarities we see. When we observe the results, we can see that having a high value would mean they are generally more inclined to the stronger side of that trait. However, when we look at neuroticism it is the opposite. Individuals who score low in neuroticism tend to be more emotionally stable and less reactive to stress. They tend to be calm, even-tempered, and less likely to feel tense or rattled. Although they are low in negative emotion, they are not necessarily high on positive emotion. Being high in scores of positive emotion is generally an element of the independent trait of extraversion. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism))\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Personas\n",
    "Using our result we defined 5 types of personas that would relate to our PCAs. Developing personas will give us more granular insights into who our customers are and potential insights on future customers. Each persona will carry unique characteristics that will embody both a Big Five trait and the Hult DNA group.\n",

    "### PCA 0 - Aspiring Professionals:\n",
    "    \n",
    "While being positive in all of our aspects, the first persona has especially remarkable values in the Hult DNA questions compared to its peers. As the Hult DNA aims to develop mission-driven, globally aware professionals, this persona is named thereafter. Simultaneously, this group of people also shows extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, all of which are skills identified as a strong performing professional.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### PCA 1 -  Confident:\n",
    "The \"Confident\" persona scores a strong negative score for neuroticism, and, as explained briefly before, this personality trait measures the emotional stability of a person. The characteristics of someone with such type of score is someone that can keep their calm under stress and are quite confident in decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PCA 2 - Introvert:\n",
    "\n",
    "The introverts are well reserved individuals who prefer to spend time alone and avoid large groups. They have a hard time socializing as they are very private when it comes to sharing details about their life. They like to keep things in order, come prepared to school or work, are goal-driven, and persistent. They follow regular schedules and work hard to achieve their goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PCA 3 - The Risk Averse:\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to their peers, the risk averse persona finds it important to get along with others. These individuals are helpful, friendly, considerate, and generous. They are generally more closed-off, resistant to change, and analytical. They stick to the tried and true methods and are as such named thereafter. \n",

    "We can continue our profiling by developing names for our clusters to see if we can go more specific in the clusters we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adventurous: \n",
    "This cluster is identified by the following combination of PCA personalities we identified.\n",
    "Very low in aspiration for professionalism, indicating that climbing the corporate ladder and creating a career professionally is not a priority for these people. While being moderately confident, this cluster is rather introverted with a medium low score for introvertism. They tolerate risk and even seem to have no problem with seeking it, indicated by the moderately low score for risk aversion.\n",
    "This cluster also consists of people who are relatively high in self reliance. This means they are confident enough in their skills and take action relying on only themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Player:\n",
    "This cluster is mainly characterized by two extreme personality types: High introvertism and very low self reliance. These persons need a team around them to rely on and ultimately help themselves to perform at their best. Even though they are not extroverted, they don’t shy the risk, making them the undercover risk seeker within group dynamics. This is indicated by the low score of risk aversion. They also are only slightly elevated within the aspiring professionals trait, making it seem like they enjoy it more to be in the background and fulfilling supportive roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conservatives:\n",
    "This cluster is defined by having very high ambitions to become an aspiring professional. They are aiming to be exactly that by fulfilling very conservative traits of personality. Being characterized by moving within the moderate areas of every personality group, they are rather low in confidence but still extroverted potentially because they realize that to become successful they need to get awareness. They are moderately risk averse as it fits in with being conservative but rely on themselves in a moderate way. They seem to go the common road on those traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self Starters:\n",
    "The students in this cluster rely on others and bring high confidence to the team they are working with. Even though they are moderately high in introvertism, they do not lack the confidence. It seems as if they like to push their ideas into a team environment to mitigate the risk as they are characterized by being rather risk averse. These students seem to be more or less indifferent about focusing on their careers or rather living a laissez faire life, but enjoy starting the conversations about specific topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditionalists:\n",
    "These students like to keep to themselves. They are low in confidence and high in introvertism, resulting in a high level of self reliance. Traditionally, they are tackling problems on their own but barely taking risks, as they are relatively high in risk aversion. They do not have aspirations for their professional future and seem to enjoy working with what they are used to. This cluster likes it’s own traditions and it seems like it barely moves away from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leaders:\n",
    "The leaders cluster is mainly characterized by being very open to risk. They do not fear any potential damages and combined with their confidence, like to tackle them on their own. These people believe in themselves and their ability almost all the time and regardless of the situation they find themselves in. They have aspirations for their career and try to fulfill them by taking risks and going for the big shots instead of a steady approach. Being neutral in introvertism/extrovertism makes it seem like they adapt to situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small Community:\n",
    "The students in this cluster love social contact and being in the center of social dynamics. This is represented by the high extrovertism. They also do not rely on themselves when tackling tasks but rather make it a team effort. They also don’t seem to put a big importance on their professional aspirations compared to being socially acknowledged. The moderately low score in risk aversion shows that they don’t seek the risk but are fine with taking them once in a while.\n",

    "- The second highest cluster in Gen Y of about 17% is the traditionalists cluster. This group is low in confidence and high in introvertism, resulting in a high level of self reliance. Traditionally, they are tackling problems on their own but barely taking risks, as they are relatively high in risk aversion. This group had 40% of their responders wanting a Windows laptop next.

    "# 8. OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after exploring demographic trends within our responders, and learning more about laptop preference we can see how the effects of Big Five personality traits and Hult DNA groupings define preference. Exploring the results of our PCAs and Cluster analysis provide insights into unique customer segments, and showcases the impact of Windows demand over time and characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 1\n",
    "There was an even split for both Macbook and Windows laptops; 51% of audience size for Macbook and 49% for Windows. However, there was a 7% drop; 4.9% to Macbook and the rest to Chromebook, in future laptop ownerships for Windows. In grouping the age for further analysis, Gen Z preferred purchasing a Macbook (75%: 45 users). The Windows proportion for Gen Y, declined by 9% from 53%, totaling 30 users, which is a significant drop in interest from their older customers. This indicates an overall loss in market share for Windows if laptops are the same price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 2\n",
    "Focusing on South America, there is a clear distinction in their laptop ownership. Looking at Windows laptop preference, for South America, 69% (35 users) favor a Windows laptop. Macbook prices in South America are some of the highest rates in comparison to other countries, which could be a big reason Windows computers are preferred (Nottrodt, 2020). However, despite the apparent higher prices in South America, when asked what would be their ideal next laptop, there is a decline in Windows users, falling from 69% to 52%, totaling 8 users. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 3\n",
    "Comparing the regions, we analyzed vs. the top 5 nationalities surveyed, we found:\n",
    " - All regions except Europe lose interest in Windows by an average 11%.\n",
    " - We observed Chinese, German and American students increase interest by an average of 13%.\n",
    " \n",
    "Considering these factors, there is an opportunity to explore more and find final conclusions for marketing opportunities:\n",
    " - This could mean that highly educated people, in the countries mentioned above, see benefits in using Windows.\n",
    " - International students could be an interesting market for Microsoft to target.\n",
    " - Young professionals may see an added value to buying Windows early on their careers.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 4\n",
    "Focusing on genders currently, 55% (125 users) of males own a Windows, compared to 41% of females. However, looking at how males respond to their next laptop preference, males ownership of Windows laptops drop by 8% (31 users), Macbook increases by 5% (20 users), and some switch their preference to Chromebooks (12 users). There is an evident decline in male's Windows laptop preference. In comparison, females' preference Macbooks stays consistent, seeing growth in current ownership to future ownership from 59% (97 users) to 63% (104 users).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 5\n",
    "Although the users from the African region only accounted for 7% (28 users) of the dataset, they had large changes in laptop preference. Current ownership for Windows laptops with African users is 43%, but when asked what they preferred for their next laptop, the proportion dropped by 15%. The total percentage of Windows laptop ownership for users from the African region dropped to 29%. We can stipulate that consumers are more interested in Macbooks if given a choice for their next laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "As demand for Windows laptops generally seems to decrease for US students, the demand for some of the international students is still increasing. Additionally, the number of international students in the US was at an all-time high in 2019 ([IIE](https://www.iie.org/Why-IIE/Announcements/2019/11/Number-of-International-Students-in-the-United-States-Hits-All-Time-High)) making it a huge potential market for Windows. Especially students from China coming to the US are growing at a strong rate creating a potential market of almost 370,000 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these facts, it is recommended to target a specific marketing campaign towards this group of students. As Microsoft is already offering a discount for international students ([EduRef](https://www.eduref.net/discount-laptops-college-students/)), we recommend broadening that campaign to collaborate with international schools offering them the opportunity to get their PCs. This could be targeted towards locking students in the long-term by making them familiar with the handling and processes within their suite. It is also recommended to broaden this campaign to include the suite for free on those discounted devices. Like that, students will be familiar with the software and might start paying for it even after their student life as part of a regular subscription, yielding return and maintaining market share for Microsoft in the long run. \n"
